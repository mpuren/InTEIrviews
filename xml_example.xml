    <paragraph n="1"> Even though using "lorem ipsum" often arouses curiosity due to its resemblance
        to classical Latin, it is not intended to have meaning. Where text is visible in a document,
        people tend to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall presentation, so
        publishers use lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design in order to direct the focus
        to presentation. "Lorem ipsum" also approximates a typical distribution of spaces in
        English.</paragraph>
    <paragraph n="2">The text is derived from <name>Cicero</name>'s <title><italic>De Finibus
                Bonorum et Malorum</italic></title> (On the Ends of Goods and Evils, or
        alternatively [About] The Purposes of Good and Evil ). The original passage began: Neque
        porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit
        (Translation: "Neither is there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus
        wants to obtain it"). It is not known exactly when the text acquired its current standard
        form; it may have been as late as the 1960s. The passage was discovered by Richard
        McClintock, a Latin scholar who is the publications director at Hampden-Sydney College in
        Virginia, by searching for citings of the rarely used word 'consectetur' in classical
        literature.</paragraph>
