    <paragraph n="1" type="intro" resp="john"> Even though using "lorem ipsum" often arouses curiosity due to its resemblance to
        classical Latin, it is not intended to have meaning. Where text is visible in a document,
        people tend to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall presentation, so
        publishers use lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design in order to direct the focus
        to presentation. "Lorem ipsum" also approximates a typical distribution of spaces in
        English.</paragraph>
    <paragraph n="2">The text is derived from <author>Cicero</author>'s <title>De Finibus Bonorum et
            Malorum</title> (On the Ends of Goods and Evils, or alternatively [About] The Purposes
        of Good and Evil ). The original passage began: Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum
        quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit (Translation: "Neither is there anyone who
        loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants to obtain it"). It is not known exactly
        when the text acquired its current standard form; it may have been as late as the 1960s. The
        passage was discovered by <persName>Richard McClintock</persName>, a Latin scholar who is
        the publications director at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, by searching for citings of
        the rarely used word 'consectetur' in classical literature.</paragraph>
