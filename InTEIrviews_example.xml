               <desc>This data contains findings of the study on outsourcing of external development
                  assistance in maternal and child health (MCH) in Malawi and Nepal. It outlines the
                  institutional modalities and norms guiding the financing and delivery of MCH
                  projects and programmes. First, our study of external development assistance
                  reveals a messy assemblage of actors, institutional arrangements and activities
                  informed by the norms: ‘value for money’ and ‘measurable results’. Second, we
                  found that for development assistance to function effectively it is not just about
                  the flow of financial resources to a project or a programme but also about
                  networks and key personal and institutional relationships. Third, we found that
                  there is increasing political pressure to show that the disbursement of resources
                  are linked to the achievement of measurable results. </desc>
